     *  Factory pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java
     *
     * -› it is about using a factory class to produce instances
     *      of objects based on a set of input parameters
     *
     * - it is similar to the builder pattern although it is focused on supporting class polymorphism
     *
     * In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic
     * to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface
     *
